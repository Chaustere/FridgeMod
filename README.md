# FridgeMod
This is a Minecraft mod that adds a new block (the Fridge) which can store up to 9 stacks of items.
This block has no recipe, it can only be given to a player with a command, the creative inventory (the block is within the Builder Blocks tab), or a mod (or even by manually adding a recipe through a JSON file).
